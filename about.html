	 <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello, the name's Maranda and I'm an avid, yet still aspiring, figure collector.
</p>
<p>I've been building my collection slowly since the beginning of high school. For the most part, I stick with my theme of video game characters! 
</p>
 <p>I've learned a good bit on how to go about buying figurines through the 5 years I've been collecting, so I thought I'd help others out.</p>
	 
				

	<h2>Creation</h2>		
		<p>I've often had times where I needed the helping hand of the internet to make sure I wasn't making mistakes when starting a new hobby.
</p>	
		<p>I felt that I should share my knowledge with those who also need the help. The few years I've been doing this has taught me a lot after all.
</p>	
		<p>You'll find Model Madness to be full of all the advice I could give to anyone trying to start their new hobby of figure collecting!</p>	
	
	
	<h2>Offerings</h2>
	<p>Throughout my site, I offer helpful advice on the different types of figurines you're able to collect.
</p>
	<p>Along with this, I go over the best ways for you to manage your spending and choices before you buy.
</p>
	<p>I even offer some basics for maintaining your collection properly so everything remains looking good as new!</p>
