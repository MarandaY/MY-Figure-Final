	<br> <br>
	
	<p>Action figures are probably what you first think of when you hear the word "figurine." 
	They're those familiar posable toys that most people had while growing up. 
<br>
	Although, there's significantly more variety to them than that!
<br>
	Plenty of people collect action figures due to the variety you have with the added articulation. You can make your own scene with all your favorite characters to have for a fun display!</p>
	
	
	<h3 align="center">How Action Figures Differ</h3>
	
	<img src="images/nendo.png" width="500">
	
	<p>Many different types of action figures exist in the world. It's up to you to decide on which types you prefer. A basic rundown on a few of the different options is as follows:
</p>
	
	<ol>
	<li>High-end display action figures</li>
		<br>
	<li>Low-end Casual action figures</li>
		<br>
	<li>Good Smile Nendoroids</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>The first option is fairly common in collection. These are the types of action figures that are made at a much higher quality. Their main purpose is just to be displayed after being posed. Because of their quality though, they can be quite pricey.
</p>
	
	<p>The second option is for if you have a tighter budget to work with, or if you just want a more casual collection. These are the types of action figures you can just buy easily from hobby stores or toy sections. They're just as valid for a collection, and they are much more affordable, they just won't have as much detail or posability.
</p>
	
	<p>The third option is a bit more specific, but some people like to solely collect Nendoroids for their display. They are small, chibi versions of characters from a vast amount of series. Some can be more expensive than others, but their small size typically makes them affordable while still having a very high quality to them.</p>
