	<br>
	<p>Model kits are actually pretty similar to action figures, in that most have articulated joints. The main difference is that you actually have to build model kits yourself!
<br><br>
Kits come with an assortment of individual parts that you have to take the time to cut out and put together.
<br><br>
Think of it like a more complex Lego set. You're given instructions on how to put everything together, and once you're done you'll have a fully functioning figurine!
<br><br>
The DIY aspect of model kits actually allows for, depending on the size of the kit, a more affordable alternative than action figures of specific characters.</p>

	<article>
	<p>The world of model kits is actually quite a complex one. There is quite a huge variety of kits you can buy, but I'll simply go over the most common ones:
</p>
	
	<ol class="infolist">
	<li>Character model kits</li>
		<br>
	<li>Gundam/Mech model kits</li>
		<br>
	<li>Object model kits</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>The first option is my personal favorite, but it is simply a model kit type where you build a model of any available character. You more commonly see this with either anime characters or characters similar to the Mega Man style. Usually pretty affordable since they aren't very big, a good choice if you're willing to put in the effort.
</p>
	
	<p>The second choice is a very popular option for a lot of people, model kits where you get to build your own mech. These are usually time consuming and tedious to make, but they have such a high level of detail that it makes for a very imposing collection. These can have a very big range in prices, but most of the nice ones are on the expensive side of things.
</p>
	
	<p>The third option is a very niche type, but there are plenty of people who love to build model kits of specific car and aircraft models. It's for a very specific audience, but if that's what you've been wanting to collect then they are actually very affordable. Very few go above the $50 range unless it's much higher end.
</p>
		
	<p>It should also be noted that model kits have two main build types; snap on or self-serving. Snap on kits have pieces that are ready to just snap together as soon as their cut out, while the self-serving kits need to be glued individually.
