	<br> 
	
	<p>Statues, also referred to as statuettes, are the non-posable counterpart to action figures.
They come in a set position that they can almost never move from, as they are unarticulated.
<br> <br>
While you may be unable to pose them yourself, the trade off is that statues typically come in iconic character poses already.
<br> <br>
You can have a much more dynamic-looking display that doesn't take long at all to set up. Not only can the poses have more movement to them, but the figures themselves are often significantly more detailed than anything articulated!</p>
	
	
	<h3 align="center">How Statues Differ</h3>
	
	<img src="images/dstatuettes.png" alt="Small, yet detailed and affordable."  width="500">
	
	<p>Just as with the other types of figures, statues also have their own variations to choose from. To give another basic rundown on a few choices:
</p>
	
	<ol>
	<li>Statuettes</li>
		<br>
	<li>Fully static statues</li>
		<br>
	<li>Minimal articulation statues</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>The first option is the most common part of any collection involving non-posable statues. These are essentially mini scale models of the character, and the same character can actually have multiple statues for different poses. Absolutely on the cheaper end for anyone wanting a casual collection of decent quality figures.
</p>
	
	<p>While statuettes still provide a good baseline, to get to the much fancier end are the fully static statues. These have the same concept of being much more dynamic and detailed versions of characters, just at a much bigger scale. Statuettes are typically around the 1/16 to 1/12 scale, statues on the other hand are 1/8 scale and above. They can be huge and amazingly detailed, but you're going to have to pay more than a pretty penny if you want to add these to your collection.
</p>
	
	<p>The third option is almost the same as the second, just with the added feature that some statues allow for a very slight amount of articulation. This almost always means you have the ability to set them up in one of the character's iconic poses, but that's as far as the customization goes. Due to the nature of statues being much bigger, these can also be quite pricey.
